# TestSequencer

## Architecture 
- cloud (potentially can offer custom on-premises hosting service for data-sensitive applications)
  - Kubernetes web services cluster :
    - front-end client
      - used by superadmins for account creation/administration, user creation/administration
      - used by admins for user creation/administration, product creation/administration
    - web API
      - receiving data from remote nodes
      - serving data to front-end
      - persisting received data to storage
    - cloud nosql database
      - stores real-time data and state
      - functions as a data lake for 'relatively recent' data (exact definition of 'relatively recent', TBD)
      - will be configured to perform archiving of data older than 'relatively recent' to S3 or other cloud object storage
- on-premises
  - local nosql instance for generated data awaiting upload to cloud
  - TestNodeLogicEngine background service that will be responsible for running physical test logic/interfacing with equipment
  - TestNodeLifeline background service for communicating time-sensitive test state data to cloud for updating front-end
  - TestNodeUploader background service for performing migration of on-premises data to cloud
  - TestNodeSupervisor background service for monitoring TestLogicEngine, TestLifeline, TestUploader service states and reporting state of node to cloud for update in front-end

# Setting up the implementation from scratch : 
1) Create jwt-secret in kubernetes using : 'kubectl create secret generic jwt-secret --from-literal=JWT_KEY=...'
2) Use the latest deployment command for Kubernetes Ingress Nginx from https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#quick-start. This is the current one at time of writing : kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.7.1/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
